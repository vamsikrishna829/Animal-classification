**🐾 Animal Image Classification**

**Objective**

  The objective of this project is to build an image classification system that can accurately identify the type of animal in a given image. The classification is performed on a dataset     containing 15 different animal categories.

**📂 Dataset Description**

  The dataset consists of 15 folders, each corresponding to a unique animal class. Each folder contains images with dimensions 224 x 224 x 3, making them suitable for input into     
  classical image classification algorithms and deep learning models.

**🐾 Animal Classes:**
  Bear

  Bird

  Cat

  Cow

  Deer

  Dog

  Dolphin

  Elephant

  Giraffe

  Horse

  Kangaroo

  Lion

  Panda

  Tiger

  Zebra

**🛠️ Methodology**

  This project primarily uses classical machine learning techniques to classify animal images.

**Steps Followed:**

**Data Preprocessing:**
  Image resizing and normalization
  
  Flattening or feature extraction (e.g., HOG/SIFT for classical methods)
  
  Label encoding and dataset splitting

**Model Selection:**

  Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier used for image classification
  
  Different kernel types and hyperparameters experimented with for optimal results
  
  Model Training and Evaluation:
  
  Training on the processed dataset
  
  Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

**Result Analysis:**

  Misclassified samples were reviewed
  
  Insights gathered to improve model performance

**📊 Evaluation Metrics**

  Accuracy: Primary metric to evaluate overall model performance
  
  Precision, Recall, F1-Score: For each class
  
  Confusion Matrix: To identify class-wise strengths and weaknesses

**🚀 Future Improvements**

  To improve performance and robustness, the following approaches can be explored:
  
  Experiment with Neural Networks (CNNs) for more accurate feature learning
  
  Use Transfer Learning with pre-trained models (e.g., VGG, ResNet, MobileNet)
  
  Implement Data Augmentation to handle class imbalance or limited data
  
  Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques
